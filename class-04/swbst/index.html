                We've entered the Alderaan system. Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board. Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life! I surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself! Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.

                A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own. Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us. Look at him. He's headed for that small moon. I think I can get him before he gets there...he's almost in range. That's no moon! It's a space station. It's too big to be a space station. I have a very bad feeling about this. Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power. Why are we still moving towards it? We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in! But there's gotta be something you can do! There's nothin' I can do about it, kid. I'm in full power. I'm going to have to shut down. But they're not going to get me without a fight! You can't win. But there are alternatives to fighting.
